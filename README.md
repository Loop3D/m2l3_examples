# m2l3_examples

This library contains datasets (hosted in GDrive) and workflows to test/develop map2loop. Each folder contains a specific dataset. 

The map2loop code in this repo's notebooks should run on a Colab environment (feel free to get in touch if not). 

The notebooks may also be run locally, provided that the data is downloaded from the GDrive link in the first cell of each notebook.
